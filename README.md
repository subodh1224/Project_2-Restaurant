Project was to recommend a restaurant based on the different cases. In this project we have used PySpark, SparkSQL, jupyterNotebook, Cloudera 5

In this project we have downloaded a dataset from Kaggle which consisits of the restaurant details in bangalore. We have performed preprocessing on this dataset and used the sample data 1500 records. We have processed this data in SparkSQL to extract some usecases from the user perspective. We have added few more columns to the existing dataset from restaurant point of view.
