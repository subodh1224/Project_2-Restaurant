## Project_2-Restaurant_recomendation System

In this project, we have downloaded a dataset from Kaggle which consists of the restaurant details in Bangalore. We have performed preprocessing on this dataset and used the sample data of 1500 records. We have processed this data in Spark SQL to extract some use cases from the user perspective. We have added few more columns to the existing dataset from the restaurant's point of view.

### Environment / Technologies :

- Spark 
- Spark Sql
- Hadoop
- Hive
- Jupyter
- Kaggle
- Cloudera 5

#### Features :
 - Partitioning :- It was used to make our data more accessible and presentable
 - Bucketing:- It was used mainly for price column ,So that we can bucket the high ranges of price into minimal number of buckets
 - Data PreProcessing:- We used Python for data processing to remove all the null values and to add new data
